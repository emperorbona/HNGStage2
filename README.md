#HOW TO USE THE MOVIE BOX WEB APP

Navigation: The "Moviebox" logo takes you to the home screen containing the most popular movies;

Seeing the Overviews: The movie cards themselves on the home page will take you to an overview page on the click of the card.

///////////////////////////////////// NOTE: Only the logo on the movie poster is clickable. Not the poster itself. So to access the overview you should click on any area at all below the poster. ////////////////////////////////////

The search bar allows you to find your desired movies which can also be clicked to give an overview(details) of the movie selected.

Getting movie overviews by id: On the movie/:id parameter, you can enter any possible movie id. If the Id isn't in the api database then you would get a resource not found error else you'll see the overview of the movie id.
